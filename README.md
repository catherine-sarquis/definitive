# Definitive.

Welcome to the repo for **Definitive.** Definitive. is an intuitive, no-fuss dictionary tool to look up English words of your choice. 

I designed Definitive. to have a minimalist design that allows the user to focus on reading the content. Tailwind CSS worked well for implmenting the clean design to the components.
